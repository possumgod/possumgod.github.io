        <div class="MRS_output">
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            Originally built for my Computational Music Theory class final project, the following is a retrieval system using similar techniques 
            to TF-IDF in Information Retrieval to return closely related music pieces in a collection given a query file. The project relies on
            the <em>PrettyMIDI</em> library to dissect and compare information stored in the files.

        <h3 class="sidemenu">ASA DataFest Presentation</h3>
        <p>
            The American Statistical Association's DataFest is a 3-day data analysis competition for undergraduate students to showcase their technical & 
            soft skills. In 2025, <a href="https://www.rit.edu/science/datafest" target="_blank">one of the events was held at RIT</a>, my university; my team,
            <i>The Horrors, LLC</i>, got 3rd in the "Best Insights" category (despite being our first year participating!). Each group gave a presentation to
            a panel of judges and peers on our findings, we used <em>Python</em>, <em>R</em>, <em>MATLAB</em>, and <em>Excel</em> to support our hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dataset was comprised of leasing and property information for a leasing company focused in the corporate leasing sector. Out of the various
            industries in the dataset, we decided to focus on determining trends in successful Coworking companies, creating a model for the properties they 
            leased that are factors of their success.

        <h3 class="sidemenu">LinkedIn Network Visualization</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 5px;">
            Using term frequency and bag-of-words methods, the program creates a visualization of a user's LinkedIn connections. Using exported data from
            LinkedIn, a network graph is generated using the <em>Networkx</em> and <em>MatPlot</em> libraries. With node colors based on search terms and/or frequency of terms 
            from the root user's headline, it creates a simple visualization of a user's connections. The distances of each node from the root user also 
            correspond to the duration of that connection. Additionally, each node is hyperlinked to that user's profile, making it easier to migrate this 
            information back to the platform.
        </p>
            <figure id="network">
                <img src="images/network_13-11-25.png" alt="My Linkedin network run through the program, some user nodes are red, green, blue, or pink" id="network_graph">

            <figcaption>My LinkedIn network as of 13th of November, 2025</figcaption>
        <p>
            Each node's color is determined by an RGB value, this value is determined by the top three 'relevant' terms from term frequency compared to the root
            user's headline. If a user's headline contains none of the most frequent terms, then the color is grey; otherwise, the RGB value (aka the relevancy) is calculated using
            term frequency. For now, the program only takes individual words into account (so combined phrases are not factored into anything). The user can also
            provide (up to three) terms to search by/include by default in the RGB calculation, regardless of how often they appear.

        <h3 class="sidemenu">Network Analysis on Political Book Purchases</h3>
        <p>
            Based on a dataset from 2004, collected by Krebs, V., I wrote up an analysis on grouping behavior of political books purchases from during the US presidential election.
            Through graph analysis using <em>Gephi</em> and <em>Tableau</em>, I determined several groups of "buyers" for political books; also categorizing their estimated leanings 
            using their purchases based on clustering and centrality. I also hypothesized how these groups have changed in recent elections and what other topics this model could apply to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The graph has 105 nodes and 441 edges, where the edges represent books that were often bought together. The average degree was 8.4 (so people were buying 9-10 books). 
            I ran though a few different layouts, and decided Fruchterman-Reingold's was visually appealing and made graphical sense. When working with the graph in Gephi, I applied a color 
            ranking based on closeness centrality (pink is low, green is high) and node sizing based on clustering (the smaller the node, the lower the coefficient). I found that many nodes 
            with low closeness centrality also had high clustering, which I think implies that while those books may not be bought with as wide of a variety, they are frequently 
            bought with a small group.

        <h3>Text-based Adventure Game</h3>
        <p>
            This is one of my first projects, back from high school, but I am still very proud of the work I put in, even today. Made in <em>Python</em>, you play as a detective tasked with
            solving a murder mystery. While a relatively simple premise, the real twist is when you replay it; there are 9 unique endings, with about 3 achievable in every run (the rest are
            dependent on random events).

        <h2 class="sidemenu">Experience</h2>
        
        <h3>Ivy Capital Partners | Dublin, Ireland</h3>
        <h4>Intern [Sept - Nov, 2025]</h4>
        <p>
            Working with a variety of global clients to bring them key insights through Ivy Capital's network. I participated in calls with entrepreneurs and CEOs for variety of companies,
            including TDK, ISA, Auddy, and many more. Since Ivy is agnostic on sector, I quickly adapted to meet the needs of varying companies; communicating with pre-seed to Series B expansions. 
            By using <em>JSON</em>, I also created workflows with Microsoft integration to automate processes, allowing the team to focus on client engagement:
            <ul>
                <li>A weekly reminder for clients that hadn't been interacted with for a designated amount of time</li>
                <li>A slide deck generated post-meeting using AI to determine objectives for the partnership for new clients</li>
                <li>Determining and sorting relevant client files uploaded into Ivy Capital's file share</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I've also made adjustments to their website in <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>HTML</em>, increasing usability and accessibility. I optimized Ivy Capital's website for Google SEO rankings, 
            increasing the score by more than 20 points. I also increased accessibility by 25%, based on SiteImprove AI's scoring, this included ensuring all the elements were keyboard-navigable, a screen reader could
            accurate parse each page, and the site elements had high readability contrast. These changes have had a proven effect, as site traffic during my internship has overall increased by 33% (per month).

        <h3 class="sidemenu">Reporter Magazine | Rochester, NY</h3>
        <h4>IT Manager & Systems Admin [September 2024 - Current]</h4>
        <p>
            Responsible for website management, content migration, and Campus Groups management. Site traffic has increased by more than 120% and user stickiness (Weekly users / Monthly users) has steadily increased 
            by 25%. Our retention rate is on average 65% higher than expected, according to Google Site Analytics; our user engagement duration has also increased by almost 2 weeks. As a part of Eboard staff, I am also
            responsible for attending and leading weekly meetings with general members and university staff. This includes giving website usage demos for members, presentations on new features, and executing feedback
            on website features.
