            Since dabbling in video editing at <a href="index.html#DVU">DVU</a>, I've occasionally made videos outside of my direct coursework. This is my current favorite video,
            for my Chinese Cinema Class, about gender identity in the film <i>Woman Demon Human</i>. You can find my other work on my channel, including an interview, Masking PSA,
            and a music video.

                    Gender expectations are becoming increasingly irrelevant as people realize they're not the only
                    aspect of someone's lived experience. Typically, when we see this behavior in film, it focuses on
                    a queer-coded character. But this isn't only relevant or exclusive to queer people, as every
                    person lives somewhere on a spectrum of identity and expression. Woman Demon Human is a
                    film that bends these expectations: we follow Qiu Yun as she deals with the struggles of existing
                    outside the binary as she navigates her opera singer/actor career. Her role as Zhong Kui heavily
                    influences her view of herself and how others view her, starting at a young age.

                <p>
                    The film utilizes visuals to metaphorically show Yun's inner dialogue, often through
                    cryptic scenes from Quelling the Demons (the opera he's from). This disconnect also represents
                    a dissatisfaction within herself, separated from parts of her identity due to societal expectations
                    of who she should be as a woman. The film begins in a space separated from reality: a version
                    of Qiu Yun preparing for a performance of Zhong Kui, split by varying distorted reflections (the
                    exaggerated features lend to physical expectations demanded of her). The film ends rather
                    abruptly (in this same no-space) after she confronts Zhong Kui, finally accepting that part of
                    herself that lives outside of the norm.

                    When Yun first expressed to her father that she wanted to play male roles, his support
                    came with the caveat that he would 'train her like a boy'; implying that in order to play the part,
                    her physical self must be more aligned with the strength and attitude of a man. So -- already as
                    a kid -- she must alienate herself from the traditional stereotypes of femininity. We see her
                    continually wrestle with this part of her identity as she gets older, trying to keep her stage
                    performance separate from her personal life.

                    This scene is soon followed by her being kicked out of a restroom because others
                    thought she was a boy, regardless of how much she and her friends insist they're mistaken. This
                    leads to a crowd (of primarily men) demanding that she “prove it”, trying to strip her of her
                    autonomy for the sake of conformity. Society tends to sexualize young girls, this event probably
                    contributed to her withdrawal from masculine and feminine traits (as both have negative
                    consequences).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As she gets older, we see Yun's behavior is outside what's expected of her, specifically
                    how she treats her opera teacher, Zhang. The other girls she's with also exclusively refer to her
                    as “tomboy”, further isolating her from them. This lack of respect for authority is typically seen as
                    'boyish' behavior, setting her apart from other girls as a teenager. She's one of the few -- if not
                    only -- student that mocks him. But, she still has a moment after being told off where she vows
                    to curse off anyone who calls her a tomboy, revealing that part of her wants to blend into typical
                    femininity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this interaction, we see her applying feminine makeup, an attempt “to recover her
                    feminine beauty”, when Zhang approaches her. He tells her she looks beautiful and could play
                    female roles if she wanted, but is made for the “kung fu part”. This causes her to reflect on who
                    she wants to be, believing the “role she plays will reflect her gender identity” and wanting to
                    embrace her femininity; she believes that her identity and expression must match -- both on and
                    off stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Zhang, in contrast, found her beauty to be in the fact that “gender and costume
                    retain their distinctions”, finding Yun's separation of the two attractive. A while later, he finds her
                    again (this time in the fields) practicing kung fu; this time he professes his love to her before she
                    exclaims against and leaves. This sequence, in particular, shows her internal conflict,
                    expressing “her fear of returning to a female identity”. She's already so far outside of what's
                    expected of her, surely there's no way to return to that, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the last pivotal moments is in response to a potential sabotage of her
                    performance: she spreads red, white, and black paint on her face. This is also the first time we
                    see Yun and Zhong share the same (figurative) space. This is the moment of self-acceptance
                    for Yun, while it may be out of rage, she feels that her existence is a performance switching
                    between masculine and feminine. By smearing the paint on her face, she's not only obstructing
                    the audience's view of her, but the colors themselves represent Woman, Demon, and Human.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the film, Yun is constantly at odds with her identity, specifically with gender.
                    For her, masculinity & feminity were masks that she couldn't wear in tantum, but by the end of
                    the film, she realizes that her gender expression can lie between the two. Overall, it allows her
                    to be comfortable outside of the norm without a mask.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gender expression is a spectrum, and in the eyes of society, how one presents
                    themselves changes how they're treated, which can drastically affect someone's self-view -- by
                    extension. Qiu Yun's Journey throughout Woman Demon Human shows how femininity and
                    masculinity are both attributes of a person that can coexist, rather than be at odds with each
                    other.
